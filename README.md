# Warring-Nations-MoreMathEdition

Samuel Do, a previous Kentwood student and Math Club President (2017-2020), created a game for Math Club: Warring Nations.

The Math Club community considers the game to be a staple in Math Club culture. 

The Math Club advisor suggested to make a reworked version of the game, containing what was missing the most: Math. The student created it in Java, so I will do the same.

Open source forever.

To the person who is one day remaking this game: I suggest creating new code and learn about Data Structures before beginning. After my DS class, this project would've been a lot easier with maps.
