# Warring-Nations-MoreMathEdition

A previous Kentwood student created a game for Math Club: Warring Nations.

The Math Club community considers the game to be a staple in Math Club culture. 

I want to create a reworked version of the game, containing what was missing the most: Math. The student created it in Java, so I will do the same.
